##INSTRUCTIONS

1.  Preheat oven to 200C
2.  Chop the tempeh into large chunks, we chopped it into 12 pieces. By slicing it into thin pieces it means the marinade will infuse deeper into the tempeh. Mix all the remaining ingredients for the shawarma sauce in a bowl – tamari, maple syrup, smoked paprika, ground cumin, oil and pour over the tempeh, mix well so that each piece is well covered. Transfer the marinated tempeh to a baking tray, spread the tempeh out so evenly spread out and bake in oven for 20 minutes. Turn it once during this baking time to ensure both sides cook evenly.
3.  While the tempeh is baking time to make the other components.
4.  For the salsa, chop the cucumber and cherry tomatoes into small similar sized pieces and add to a bowl. Peel and finely slice the red onion, add the salt, black pepper and oil and mix well.
5.  For the guacamole. Remove the flesh from the skin and stone of the avocado and chop it into small pieces and add to a bowl, discarding the skin and the stone. We usually slice the avocado in half, remove the stone, using a spoon remove the flesh and then chop the flesh on a board. Peel and finely chop the garlic cloves. Chop the tomatoes into small pieces and squeeze in the juice of the limes. Mix well with a fork, mashing to your desired consistency.
6.  For the refried beans. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Put a non stick pan on a high heat and add 1 tbsp oil. Once the pan and oil are hot, add the onion and fry till it starts to brown stirring regularly, this should take 5 mins approx. Add the chopped garlic and cook for a further minute stirring regularly, then add the beans and mix well. Add the spices – ground cumin, ground coriander, chilli/cayenne, black pepper and salt and mix well. Finely chop the fresh coriander along with the juice of one lime and mix through. If it looks dry add 1 tbsp of water and incorporate. Use the back of the wooden spoon to mash the beans till it comes together like a nice paste. Remove from the heat and set aside.
7.  For the chilli mayo, add all the ingredients together in a bowl and mix well.
8.  To finish the tempeh, remove from the oven once the tempeh is starting to go brown. Slice into thin long strips like a Shawarma. They add a lovely texture to this taco.
9.  For the tacos. In a bowl add the corn masa and make a well in the middle, pour the water into the centre and mix well so it all incorporates together into a large dough ball. Divide into 6 small balls. Put a sheet of baking parchment paper in our taco press and add one of our corn masa balls, close the press and flatten into a perfectly shaped taco. Add to a hot pan on a low to medium heat and cook on both sides till it starts to brown. Repeat with the remaining corn masa balls.
10. Finally to make up your tacos, we like to start with a nice dollop of the chilli mayo and then any combination of toppings that take your fancy! You can’t really go wrong as they are all super tasty! Enjoy and hope they taste wonderful!!
